# DataAnalysis_with_Python_and_Pandas_2024
 Python is being widely used in the data science domain and hence it is important to learn how to use Python to analyse data. Hence in this section we learn how to use the tools and techniques used to perform data analysis. We start off by learning the Pandas library which is used to perform data analysis and all the basic concepts like DataFrames, Reindexing, Indexing, Broadcasting and also learn how to perform data plotting and visualisation with the Matplotlib library.  In this section we also have a data science project which is based on analysing supermarket data to find insightful information which helps take better business decisions. We also learn how to represent data visually using multiple types of charts and bar graphs built using matplotlib.
